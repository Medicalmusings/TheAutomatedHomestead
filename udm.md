## Product Description

I have had many, many internet routers. All have worked...sort of. All had strengths and weaknesses. Weaknesses that became apparent as my home wifi network grew both in complexity and the geographical area it covers. The Ubiquity UDM (*Unifi Dream Machine*) can be configured as a very simple device. Scratch the surface and you encounter some very very high end features - multi radio band mesh networking, flexible firewall rules, variable transmitter power, Virtual LAN - Virtual Local Area Network suport. Not the cheapest by a long way but by far the most capable device I have had access to ourside of full on corporate high end devices. And Ubiquity make those too!
I once read on a forum "never buy a Ubiquity device as you will end up purchasing Ubiquity replacements for every WiFi access point and device you have!". Guilty as charged. A Ubiquity based network is incredibly rubust, flexible and reliable.

## Technical Information

Full product specifications are available on the Ubiquity website at: [https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/other/udm](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/other/udm)
## Pros
These opinions are based on my experience using this device extensively to manage a homestead wide multi-purpose data network:
- Incredibly capable and flexible configuration options.
- Reliability - crashes or 'hangs' less often than we have an electricty supply outage. I never reboot this thing
- Low power consumption
- Unobtrusive - sits underneath the lounge TV (hence the rather dark image above)

## Cons

- In some ways too flexible. Very sensible and secure default options but if you wish you can go very deep into network configurations.
- Not the cheapest. But you get what you pay for.
