## Product Description

If you are not familiar with computer hardware and installing operating systems then _by far the easiest_ way to get started is “[Home Assistant Green](https://www.home-assistant.io/green/)”. Follow the link for the official site.
Home assistant software will run on many many platforms under many computer operating systems, including its own (HAOS). 
Software installation difficulty varies from straightforward for the technically capable ( e.g. running on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, to the arcane ( my setup running on Home assistants own operating system in a virtual machine under the UTM software emulation system as part of a homelab server system ). 
For convenience [Home Assistant Green is also available via Amazon](https://amzn.to/4trAoOp), as well as many other home automation stockists. Shop around for prices but dont forget the shipping charges!
